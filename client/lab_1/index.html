<h1>Desmond Lam's Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>

<h2>First, the basics.</h2>

You need the following to build your website.

<l1>HTML and CSS</l1>
<l1>Javascript</l1>
<l1>Node.js</l1>
<l1>And other web development frameworks</l1>

You should list your top 3 goals for the class below.

<ol>
  <li>Learn front-end web design</li>
  <li>Learn new programming languages</li>
  <li>Learn how to work with others in a technical space</li>
  <li>Learn popular web dev frameworks</li>
</ol>

<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.

<p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>

Sometimes you want to <p><em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.
If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."
